# Project Summary: Multimode Clock Source

## Implementation Complete ✅

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Raspberry Pi Pico-based multimode clock generator for retro computing applications.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Clock Modes
- **Single Step Mode**: Manual button-triggered clock with debouncing
- **Low-Frequency Mode**: Variable 1Hz-100kHz with dual-range potentiometer control
- **High-Frequency Mode**: Precise 1MHz PWM square wave
- **UART Control Mode**: Interactive command-driven frequency control (1Hz-1MHz)

### ✅ User Interface  
- **3 Push Buttons**: Debounced mode selection and step control
- **5 LED Indicators**: Clock activity + individual mode indicators
- **UART Output**: Real-time status and frequency display
- **UART Input**: Interactive command interface for UART Control Mode
- **Potentiometer**: Smooth frequency adjustment

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Proper debouncing**: 50ms delay prevents button bounce
- **PWM precision**: Hardware PWM for accurate 1MHz generation
- **Timer-based low frequencies**: Microsecond-precision software timers
- **ADC integration**: 12-bit ADC for smooth potentiometer control
- **Modular design**: Configurable via config.h
